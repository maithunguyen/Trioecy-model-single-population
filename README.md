These are supporting materials for the manuscript: The evolution and maintenance of trioecy with cytoplasmic male sterility (Nguyen and Pannell, 2024).

Python files: 
1. fixedCytoplasmic_invasionscreen.py: simulations of models without pollen limitation (model 1).
2. fixedCytoplasmic_invasionscreenPollim.py: simulations of models with pollen limitation (model 2 and 3).
3. maleinvadesgyno.py: simulations of the scenarios where CMS invades prior to males, with or without pollen limitation.
4. fixedCytoplasmic_invasion1step.py: simulations of the scenarios where CMS and males invaded at the same time, with or without pollen limitation.

Mathematica files:
1. singlepopnopollim.nb: Analyses of model without pollen limitation (model 1).
2. singlepopwithMFpollim.nb: Analyses of model with pollen limitation that causes all left-over ovules to be aborted (model 2).
3. singlepopwithWTpollim.nb: Analyses of model with pollen limitation and delayed selfing (model 3).
